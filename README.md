# Bootstrap and CSS Portfolio

## Portfolio Assignment:

Tasked with creating a responsive portfolio webpage that utilizes bootstrap and CSS, I created a consolidated HTML file that incorporates both with working links.

### Breakdown:

Linked the Bootstrap CDN and style.css in header.

Added a working navbar with my name on the left and three working links that correspond to "About Me", "Portfolio" and "Contact" sections of my page on the right.

Added a hover styling that changes any text in the header to maroon color when cursor is hovered over.

Created a background image that resizes automatically when window is resized.

Utilized container and card classes to add my picture and About Me text, and changed margin-top so a portion of the About Me section floats over background.

Created a Portfolio section with 2 elements in each row that take up six columns each to create an equal grid, adjusted margins as well to clean up.

Added images and headers to each Portfolio element.

Finally, added Contact portion to bottom of page with even margins and padding, included fillable text boxes using form-group and form-control

Added a submit button under the Contact section.

Added a centered footer displaying my name and year.
